# Ever feared those trackers, such as GoGuardian and such that spy on you all the time?
# Fear not! Run this on a DNS server on your home network, and you can rest assured
# that your personal life outside of school won't be spied on.

# DISCLAIMER:
# For any admins lookin at this repo, please understand that I don't mean ill will towards the
# education environment. This serves for people in their personal homes, who want that extra
# bit of privacy in their life, and can't store their device at school in a locker or such.

# GoGuardian, self explanatory.
